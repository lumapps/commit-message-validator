<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The provided script enforce Angular commit message convention, with an opinionated reduction of allowed types.
Moreover, it enforces reference to a project management tools named JIRA.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.
The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

- The first line of the commit message (the "Subject") cannot be longer than 70 characters.
- Any other line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!
- The body and footer are optional, but depends on the type some information can be mandatory.

This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **lint**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as distribution generation

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `notification', 'dropdown', etc.
The scope must be written in [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles).

### Subject

A brief but meaningfull description of the change.
Here are some recommandation for writing your subject:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no "." (dot) at the end

### Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
It is optional but highly recommended for any impacting changes.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference JIRA ticket related to this commit.

The footer is optional but for **feat** and **fix** type the JIRA reference is mandatory.

The breaking changes must be at the end of the commit with only "BROKEN:" before the list of breaking changes.
They must be each on a new line.

### Commit Example

```
feat(toto-service): provide toto for all

Before we had to do another thing. There was this and this problem.
Now, by using "toto", it's simpler and the problems are managed.

LUM-3462
BROKEN:
first thing broken
second thing broken
```

### Revert

The proper for revert based on Angular commit message convention should be:

```
revert: feat(toto-service): provide toto for all

This reverts commit <sha1>.
```

However, the default git behavior, that cannot be easily overiden is:

```
Revert "feat(toto-service): provide toto for all"

This reverts commit <sha1>.
```

Thus we won't enforce one or the other, we will only enfore:
* starting the commit title with revert (with a capitalized letter or not)
* having the sentence "This reverts commit <sha1>"

### Built With

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started with command line

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

1. Install bash

```sh
sudo apt install bash
```

2. Install bats for development testing

```sh
sudo apt install bats
```

### Installation

1. Clone the commit-msg-validator

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lumapps/commit-msg-validator.git
```

That's all, your ready to go !

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Check the commit message referenced by <commit1>:

```sh
./check.sh <commit1>
```

Check all the commits between 2 references:

```sh
./check.sh <commit1>..<commit2>
```

Behind the hood, the script use `git log` to list all the commit thus any syntax allowed by git will be working.

You can also use the pre-push commit validator, simply copy, `pre-push`, `validator.sh` and `check.sh` files
in `.git/hooks` directory of your repository.

### OPTIONS

- if `COMMIT_VALIDATOR_NO_JIRA` environment variable is not empty, no validation is done on JIRA refs.
- if `COMMIT_VALIDATOR_ALLOW_TEMP` environment variable is not empty, no validation is done on `fixup!` and `squash!` commits.

### Commit template

You might want to use the predefined commit template in order to keep the main information under hand.

For that, you have to add the following lines in your repository's gitconfig (located at `<project_root>/.gitconfig`).
```conf
[commit]
    template = /path/to/git-commit-template
```

## Getting Started with github action

To enable the action simply create the .github/workflows/commit-message-validator.yml file with the following content:

```yml
name: 'Commit message validation on pull request'

on:
  pull_request

jobs:
  commit-message-validation:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Commit message validation
      uses: lumapps/commit-message-validator@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### OPTIONS

- if `no_jira` is not empty, no validation is done on JIRA refs.
- if `allow_temp` is not empty, no validation is done on `fixup!` and `squash!` commits.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
