type(scope): subject

# Body

# Footer


## Types:
# feat: A new feature
# fix:  A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# lint: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
#       formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
# test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as
#        distribution generation

## Scope
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# For example `notification', 'dropdown', etc. The scope must be written in
# kebab-case.

## Subject
# A brief but meaningful description of the change. Here are some
# recommendation for writing your subject:
# - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# - don't capitalize first letter
# - no "." (dot) at the end

## Body
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with
# previous behavior.
# It is optional but highly recommended for any impacting changes.

## Footer
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also
# the place to reference JIRA ticket related to this commit.
# The footer is optional but for feat and fix type the JIRA reference is
# mandatory.
# The breaking changes must be at the end of the commit with only "BROKEN:"
# before the list of breaking changes. They must be each on a new line.

## Example
# feat(toto-service): provide toto for all
#
# Before we had to do another thing. There was this and this problem.
# Now, by using "toto", it's simpler and the problems are managed.
#
# LUM-3462
# BROKEN:
# first thing broken
# second thing broken
